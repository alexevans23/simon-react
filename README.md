# Simon Memorization Game

This was a game that we created for our web programming class that originally taught us all the basics of HTML, JS, and CSS. We slowly built onto it throughout the semester and added many Node.JS modules like express, MongoDB and WebSocket. Finally, we converted the whole thing to a React framework.
